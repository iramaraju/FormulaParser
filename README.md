# FormulaParser

# This project is to parse a mathematical formula string and evaluate the equation and return the result.
# For example. If you pass "ax^2 + bx + c" in a variable equation ie.  val e = "ax^2 + bx + c" 
# return a function that evaluates def  func1 (e :String, a=1,b=2,c=3) (x=10) = ax^2 + bx + c
#

# You may need considerable tweaking before using it. But I hope it helps you understand how to do it. Have fun
